# Hyperledger Fabric 2.5 Geo-Aware Consensus Project

This project implements a variant of etcdraft consensus algorithm for Hyperledger Fabric 2.5 with geo-location and hierarchical capabilities to reduce latency and improve performance.

## Key Components:
- Custom consensus implementation based on etcdraft
- Geo-location aware routing and leader selection
- Hierarchical network topology
- Docker Compose based deployment
- Caliper performance benchmarking
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Development Guidelines:
- Use Go for consensus algorithm implementation
- Use JavaScript/Node.js for Caliper benchmarks
- Use Docker Compose instead of docker-compose
- Follow Hyperledger Fabric 2.5 standards
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive performance metrics
